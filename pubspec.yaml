# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assests/
    - assests/tiles/
    - assests/tiles/drinktile.png
    - assests/tiles/burgertile.png
    - assests/tiles/pizzatile.png
    - assests/tiles/tacotile.png
    - assests/productcard/Like.png
    - assests/productcard/burger1.png
    - assests/productcard/burger2.png
    - assests/productcard/burger3.png
    - assests/productcard/burger4.png
   
    
    

  fonts:
    - family: OpenSans # This is the family name you'll use in your TextStyle
      fonts:
        - asset: assests/fonts/OpenSans_Condensed-Regular.ttf # Path to your regular font file
        - asset: assests/fonts/OpenSans_SemiCondensed-Bold.ttf    # Path to your bold font file

        - asset: assests/fonts/OpenSans_Condensed-SemiBold.ttf    # Path to your bold font file
          weight: 500          

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
